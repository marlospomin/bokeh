            <p>Photographers tend not to photograph what they can't see, which is the very reason one should try to attempt it. Otherwise we're going to go on forever just photographing more faces and more rooms and more places. Photography has to transcend description. It has to go beyong to bring insight into the subject, or reveal them, not as it looks, but how does it feel. I belive that there are no bad pictures; that's just how it looks sometimes. A picture is like a secret about a secret, the more it tells you the less you know, and feel.</p>
            <p>For me, the subject and emotion of the picture is aways more important than the picture itself. A photograph is a click away. A good photographer is a hundred clicks away and a better one, a thousand clicks away for a good shot sometimes, the passion that we put on it is one of the most important aspects of the whole thing, how can you make something good out off a thing that you don't like.</p>
            <p>I am a professional photographer by trade and an amateur photographer by vocation. If only I had thought of a Kodak! I could have flashed that glimpse of the Under-world in a second, and examined for more best and nice photographers.</p>

            <p>Both those taking snaps and documentary photographers, however, have not understood "information". What they produce are memories.</p>
            <p>When people look at my pictures I want them to feel the way they do when they want to read a line of poem twice. Today everything exists to end in a photograph. When I look at my old pictures, all I can see is what I used to be but am no longer.</p>
